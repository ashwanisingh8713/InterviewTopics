Hello Sir,

I know this is bussiness and organisation, which can run only when there is profite in any formate.
If this company is going to shut the mobile department for long turm then fine, but if no then please re-think who is responsible for this.

Your mobile team has vast capability and expertise in their tech.
We were almost alway engaged and worked on multiple projects, but if our superiors are not able to convert those work in cash then what can we do.
Always we are asked do this and now do this.

- The Hindu Projects(Android, iOS)
- Shorts Video News (Android, iOS)
- Server Driven UI 	(Android)
- FastID			(Android)
- Shopify POC 		(Android)
- Rappid.ai 		(Android, iOS, Web)
- Infosys Outsourcing (Flutter)

we never had stable and superior person, always new personality comes and simply go.
App9 is also one department, with this department and team members never single meeting is done by thier stable superior.
If we would be not lacking in communications and updates then we would have never got this fail condition.
All this due to our internal self earnning politics.

I am happy with organisation decision.

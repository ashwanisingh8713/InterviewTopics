Toast can be shown only from UI thread, the correct answer:
    because it can be shown only from thread with Looper.

What is Looper?
    - Looper is a worker, that serves a MessageQueue for a current thread.
    - MessageQueue is a queue that has tasks called messages which should be processed.
    - Looper is a class which is used to execute the Messages(Runnable/Task) in a queue.
    - Worker or background threads are not allowed to post any task in Message queue.
    - Looper have 2 main method Looper.prepare() and Looper.loop().

Where we can use Looper class?
    - If someone wants to execute multiple messages(Runnables) then he should use the Looper class
        which is responsible for creating a queue in the thread.

What is a heap?
A heap is a complete binary tree data structure also known as a binary heap that you can construct using an array.

Heaps come in two flavors:
1. Maxheap,inwhichelementswithahighervaluehaveahigher priority.
	The root node will always contain the highest value.
2. Minheap,inwhichelementswithalowervaluehaveahigherpriority.
	The root node will always contain the lowest value.

Note: It’s important to say that the concept of heap is valid for every type of object that can be compared to others of the same type. 

Some useful applications of a heap include:
	- Calculating the minimum or maximum element of a collection. 
	- Heap sort.
	- Implementing a priority queue.
	- Supporting graph algorithms, like Prim’s or Dijkstra’s, with a priority queue.

Scoped functions are functions that execute a block of code within the context of an object.
The context of the object can be referred to as “it” or “this” 

Let (provides an option to perform an operation on the current object)
	- It refers to the context of the object by using the “it”
	- Returns transformed or same object.
	- Easily helps in providing null checks.
	- Example 
		|	val name = Person().name?.let {
        |	"The name of the Person is: $it"
    	|	}
    	|	print(name)



Run (It is similar to `let` )
	- It refers to the context of the object by using the "this"
	- Returns transformed or same object.
	- Example
		|	private fun performRunOperation() {
		|   val person: Person? = null
		|    person?.run {
		|       name = "asdf"
		|       contactNumber = "1234"
		|       address = "wasd"
		|       displayInfo()
		|   	 }
		|	}


With (It is similar to `Run`)
	- Here performing null check is difficult
	- It refers to the context of the object by using the "this"
	- Example
		|	private fun performWithOperation() {
		|   val person: Person? = null
		|    with(person) {
		|       this?.name = "asdf"
		|        this?.contactNumber = "1234"
		|        this?.address = "wasd"
		|        this?.displayInfo()
		|   	 }
		|	}

apply (It is similar to run, but does not accept return statement)
	- It does not accept return statement
	- It changes or assign the values to properties
	- This function is used when you wish to change the object's properties or behaviour.
	- Example
		|	Intent().apply {
	    |    	action = intentAction
	    |    	data = Uri.parse(intentData)
	    |	}

also (It is used to chaining scope funtions)
	- Always returns the same object which it is referring to.
	- Example
		|	private fun performAlsoOperation() {
		|    val name = Person().also {
		|        print("Current name is: ${it.name}")
		|        it.name = "ModifiedName"
		|    }.run {
		|        "Modified name is: $name\n"
		|    }
		|    print(name)
		| }

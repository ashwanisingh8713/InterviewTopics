First of all, I would like to say thank you for shortlisting me for this interview.

I am Ashwani Kumar Singh, and I'm thrilled to be here today.

With over 12 years of experience in the world of Android app development, 

I have honed my skills to become a seasoned Lead Android Developer.

My career has been defined by a passion for creating exceptional mobile experiences and a commitment to staying at the forefront of Android technology.

My expertise spans the entire Android ecosystem, including app architecture, UI/UX design, performance optimization, and robust, scalable code development.

My approach to Android development is rooted in innovation and best practices.

In addition to technical expertise, I excel in client handling and support, ensuring that the vision of each project aligns with client expectations. 

As a team leader, I have a track record of guiding and motivating development teams to success.

I am well-versed in creating wireframes and diagrams to facilitate project planning and communication.

I am well-versed in architectural patterns like Clean Architecture, MVI (Model-View-Intent), and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), which are crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with both native and hybrid mobile app development.
I embrace the power of Kotlin Multi-Platform, harnessing its potential to share code efficiently across different platforms.

I have leveraged third parties & essential libraries such as JetPacks, Koin, Ktor, Coroutines, SQLDelight and ComposeUIs to deliver feature-rich and performant applications.

Beyond Android, I have ventured into GoLang Microservices (GIN) for building scalable backend APIs.

I thrive on keeping up with the latest industry trends and emerging technologies, ensuring that my work is always cutting-edge and capable of meeting the evolving needs of users and businesses alike.

I'm excited to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your organization's success and bring innovative mobile app solutions to life.

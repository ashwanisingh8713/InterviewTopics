It is a change to state of the app that happens outside the scope of a composable function.

DerivedStateOf			
	- It is used to derive new state based on the values of other state variables.
DisposableEffect		
	- effects that require cleanup, For side effects that need to be cleaned up after the keys
	change or if the composable leaves the Composition, use DisposableEffect.
	- It clears the effect when the Composable is removed from the screen.
rememberCoroutineScope	
	- It is used to create CoroutineScope that is tied to Composable function's lifecycle and
	It can be used to obtain a composition-aware scope to launch a coroutine outside a composable.
rememberUpdatedState	
	- reference a value in an effect that shouldn't restart if the value changes
SideEffect				
	- SideEffect is used to publish compose state to non-compose code.
	- SideEffect is triggered on every recomposition.
snapshotFlow
	- convert Compose's State into Flows
produceState			
	- convert non-Compose state into Compose state
LaunchedEffect 			
	- It is used to launch a coroutine inside the scope of composable function.
	- LaunchedEffect takes multiple keys as params and if any of the key changes
	it cancels the existing coroutine and launch again.

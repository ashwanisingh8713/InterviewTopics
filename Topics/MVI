MVI is a Reactive Architecture Pattern which is short for Model -View-Intent.

Model 	 - represents the state of UI. For example UI may have different states like loading, loaded, errors, User button submit state etc.


View 	 - In MVI, view is interfaces which is implemented in Activity or Fragment.
        It means to have container which can accept the different model states and display it as a UI.

Intent 	 - The intent simply describes an intention.
	 - We will be sending models as action to the Intents which can load or show it through Views.


Event, Result, State, Effect

Event	- Any User's Event
Result	- Response from API, DB 
State	- Data Model Class
Effect	- UI Changes


Thereâ€™s a lot of separation at every step, and this makes every part extremely easy to test.

Behavioral interview questions
    1. "Can you describe a challenging project you worked on as an Android developer and how you overcame obstacles?"
    2. "How do you prioritize tasks and manage your time effectively when working on multiple projects simultaneously?"
    3. "Tell me about a time when you had to collaborate with other team members to solve a problem or complete a project.
        How did you contribute to the team's success?"
    4. "Describe a situation where you had to adapt to changes in project requirements or technology.
        How did you handle it?"
    5. "Can you give an example of a time when you had to troubleshoot and debug a complex issue in an Android application?
        What was your approach?"
        - Reproducing the Issue:
              I first tried to reproduce the issue on my own device and emulator but couldn't replicate it.
              I then collected crash logs from affected users using services like Firebase Crashlytics and analyzed them.
        - Analyzing Crash Logs:
              I carefully examined the stack traces to identify any common patterns or exceptions that could lead to the crashes.
              I looked for any specific device models, OS versions, or user actions that might be triggering the crashes.
        - Code Review:
              I reviewed the code related to the reported crashes, focusing on areas that seemed susceptible to issues such as network calls, database operations, or memory management.
              I also checked for any recent changes in the codebase that could have introduced bugs.
        - Testing Hypotheses:
              Based on the analysis, I formulated hypotheses about possible causes of the crashes and tested them one by one.
              For example, I tested if the issue was related to a specific API response, a particular screen, or a certain user action.
        - Implementing Fixes:
            Once I identified the root cause, I implemented the necessary fixes. This could involve code changes, updates to dependencies, or improvements in error handling.
        - Testing and Validation:
              After implementing the fixes, I thoroughly tested the app to ensure that the issue was resolved.
              I also asked some affected users to test the updated version to validate that the crashes were no longer occurring for them.
        - Monitoring:
              I continued to monitor the app's performance and crash reports to ensure that the issue did not reappear.
              I also added additional logging and monitoring to detect similar issues in the future.

    7. Technical debt?
        - Technical debt is the difference between what was promised and what was actually delivered
                    in software engineering, including any technical shortcuts made to meet delivery deadlines.
        - it's the result of prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code
        - Hasty or Temporary Solutions
        - Lack of Documentation
        - Neglected Refactoring
        - Poor Design Choices

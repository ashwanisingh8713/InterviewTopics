Q. What is Variance?
- Variance refers to how subtyping, between more complex types, relates to subtyping between their components.

There are four types of Variance.
	- Covariant : if it accepts subtypes but not supertypes
		- Collection<? extends Object>. In other words, the wildcard with an extends-bound (upper bound) makes the type covariant.
	- Contravariant : if it accepts supertypes but not subtypes
					: it can only be consumed and never produced
	- Bivariant : if it accepts both supertypes and subtypes
	- Invariant : does not accept either supertypes nor subtypes
